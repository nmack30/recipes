        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
            <li>3/4 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>3/4 cup of ricotta cheese</li>
        </ul>
       
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Cheese Filling</strong>: For this recipe, you will need ricotta and mozzarella cheese. If you are like me, you will love this dish. You can add some seasoning along with parsley. If you don't like ricotta cheese, try using cottage cheese. It works great for this recipe.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Meat</strong>: I use both ground beef and italian sausage for great flavor. You can add some italian seasoning and adobo seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Sauce</strong>: To reduce your time in the kitchen, you can use pasta sauce or marinara sauce. You can also make your own pasta sauce as well.</p></li>             
        </ul>

        <p>Homemade lasagna is easy to make. I can assure you that it is worth the effort. Therefore, let's get started.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350&#8457;.</li>
            <li>Boil pasta: Boil a large pot of water and add a little salt. Follow the instructions on the box. Drain, rinse under cold water, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Prepare your meat sauce: Cook italian sausage and ground beef with onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and italian seasoning. Drain any excess oil. When your meat is done, go ahead and add your crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and tomato sauce. Let it simmer for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine cheese mixture: Now you may want to shred the mozzarella cheese if you bought it whole. Go ahead and stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl. Add an egg so your cheese mixture is combined properly.</li>
            <li>Layer and bake: Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with the lasagna noodles. Repeat until you are finish. Afterwards, put the pan in the oven and cook until browned and bubbly. Yummy!</li>
