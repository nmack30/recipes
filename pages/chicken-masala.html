        <p>I enjoy Indian cuisine but can be very expensive especially if you enjoy it as much as I do. Recently, I learnt to recreate this wonderful dish. Chicken Masala is a flavorful dish that your family will enjoy. <p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="second-heading">What is Chicken Masala?</h2>  
        <p>Chicken Masala is an indian dish made with chicken that has been marinated in yogurt mixed with different type of spices. It simmers in a rich, creamy tomato-based spiced sauce. Sometimes, it can be mistaken for Butter Chicken. However, Butter Chicken is cooked mainly with butter (hence the name) and a creamy blend of spiced tomato sauce.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="second-heading">What can I serve with Chicken Masala?</h2>   
        <p>I always serve this dish over basmati rice with freshly chopped cilantro and a side of homemade Naan bread to soak up the sauce. Yummy! If you are lazy like me, I usually order the naan bread to save some time. So let's get into the ingredients that you need for this recipe.

            <li>In a large bowl, mix together all the ingredients for the marinade. Add chicken and toss to coat. Let chicken marinate for an hour or longer if time permits.</li>
            <li>Warm oil and clarified butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, cook chicken thighs in hot butter until browned on all sides. Transfer chicken onto a plate. When cool enough, cut chicken in bite size pieces.</li>
