        <h2>What is Egusi Soup?</h2>        
            <p>Egusi Soup is very delicious. It's definitely the best soup that I've ever tasted. It is so simple to make and doesn't take a lot of time.</p>
        <br>
            <p>Egusi soup is usually prepared with pounded yam, eba, amala,rice or any other swallow of your choice. I made this soup with smoked turkey but you can use any meat of your choice.</p>
        <br>

                <li>2 cups of ground melon</li>
                <li>12 pieces of smoked turkey</li>
                <li>salt and pepper</li>
                <li>1 large chopped onion</li>
                <li>2 red bell peppers</li>
                <li>2 habanero peppers</li>
                <li>Dried prawns</li>

                <li>2 chicken bouillon</li>

        <h2>How to Make Egusi Soup?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add ground melon to a bowl, 1 cup of water and mix to form a paste. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Turn stove on medium heat. Place a large pot on medium heat. Add palm oil and heat for 3 minutes</li>
                <li>In a blender, blend together onion, red bell peppers, and habanero peppers. Pour into pot. Bring to a boil for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the egusi paste in small portions and reduce heat. Do not stir. Just cover it with a lid. Cook for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the lid and gently stir the soup. It will look lumpy but you can break it into the desire size.</li>
                <li>Add smoked turkey and beef stock. Stir until combined. Add dried prawns and chicken bouillon.</li>
                <li>Continue to cook for 15 minutes or more (Until your meat is tender). Check and stir to avoid burning the food. Add chopped spinach and stir for 5 minutes.   
                </li>
                <li>Turn off the stove and allow to cool before serving.</li>
            </ol>
